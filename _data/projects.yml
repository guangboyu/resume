- project: Tap News, Real-Time News Scraping and Recommendation System
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: 2018
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Implemented a data pipeline which monitors, scrapes and dedupes latest news (MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ)</li><li>Implemented a click event log processor which collects users’ click logs, then updates a news preference model for each user (NLP, TF-IDF)</li><li>Designed and built an offline training pipeline for news topic modeling (Tensorflow, DNN, NLP)</li></ul>

- project: Surgery Blood Cell Prediction
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: 2017
  # url: "#"
  description: In collaboration with USC’s Keck Hospital, built a Machine Learning system that optimizes the amount of blood required for surgical procedures. (Scikit-Learn, Python, Numpy, Pandas)<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Pre-processed the dataset by filling in missing data, detecting outliers and cleaning the data</li><li>conducted feature engineering and statistical analysis including label encoding, log transformation, data visualization, and feature selection</li><li>Built and tuned a Random Forest model to increase the MAE by 102% compared to the benchmark.</li></ul>

- project: Byte Cup Machine Learning Competition
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: 2016
  description: International Machine Learning Competition hosted by IEEE-China and Toutiao in which teams attempt to build the most accurate predictive models of community-based questions and answers.<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Constructed a 2-layer Stacking model in which the first layer used Factorization Machine (FM), LR, and XGBoost as the base model, which were merged and then generated the meta-features.</li><li>The second layer extracted SVD, TSNE, NMF dimension reduction information from the first layer FM model and combined this with the meta-features from the first-layer to train an XGBoost model.</li></ul>
